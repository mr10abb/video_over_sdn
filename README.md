video_over_sdn
==============

Designing a system to improve the video streaming quality over software defined networks.The OpenFlow (POX) controller will have various features for obtaining an optimum output where the packets will be disturbed evenly to avoid overloading, reducing the buffering time. It will provide a proper hold time between packet transactions to avoid delay and support security measures allowing the system to drop unhealthy packets. Dijkstra's and LARAC(Lagrange Relaxation based Aggregated Cost) Algorithm is implemented for routing the video packets to meet the delay constraint.
